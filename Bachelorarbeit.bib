abstract = {This tutorial article introduces the physics of spin transfer torques in magnetic devices. Our intention is that it be accessible to beginning graduate students. We provide an elementary discussion of the mechanism of spin transfer torque and review the theoretical and experimental progress in this field. This article is meant to set the stage for the articles which follow in this volume of the Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, which focus in more depth on particularly interesting aspects of spin-torque physics and highlight unanswered questions that might be productive topics for future research.},

@book{Hecht2002,
abstract = {4th ed. Accurate, comprehensive and precise, this revision provides students with the most up-to-date coverage of optics. Responsive to students' needs, the focus of the revision was to fine-tune the pedagogy, modernize the discourse, and update the content. This book continues the gradually modernizing treatment of the previous edition by imparting an appreciation of the central role of atomic scattering, providing an understanding of the insightful perspective offered by the Fourier Theory, and by, from the outset, explicating the underlying quantum mechanical nature of light. Additionally, Hecht addresses all of today's significant technological advances. A brief history -- Wave motion -- Electromagnetic theory, photons, and light -- The propagation of light -- Geometrical optics -- More on geometrical optics -- The superposition of waves -- Polarization -- Interference -- Diffraction -- Fourier optics -- Basics of coherence theory -- Modern optics : lasers and other topics.},

@article{Zutic2004,
abstract = {Spintronics, or spin electronics, involves the study of active control and manipulation of spin degrees of freedom in solid-state systems. This article reviews the current status of this subject, including both recent advances and well-established results. The primary focus is on the basic physical principles underlying the generation of carrier spin polarization, spin dynamics, and spin-polarized transport in semiconductors and metals. Spin transport differs from charge transport in that spin is a nonconserved quantity in solids due to spin-orbit and hyperfine coupling. The authors discuss in detail spin decoherence mechanisms in metals and semiconductors. Various theories of spin injection and spin-polarized transport are applied to hybrid structures relevant to spin-based devices and fundamental studies of materials properties. Experimental work is reviewed with the emphasis on projected applications, in which external electric and magnetic fields and illumination by light will be used to control spin and charge dynamics to create new functionalities not feasible or ineffective with conventional electronics.},

@article{Bader2010,
abstract = {Spintronics encompasses the ever-evolving field of magnetic electronics. It is an applied discipline that is so forward-looking that much of the research that supports it is at the center of basic condensed matter physics. This review provides a perspective on recent developments in switching magnetic moments by spin-polarized currents, electric fields, and photonic fields. Developments in the field continue to be strongly dependent on the exploration and discovery of novel material systems. An array of novel transport and thermoelectric effects dependent on the interplay between spin and charge currents have been explored theoretically and experimentally in recent years. The review highlights select areas that hold promise for future investigation and attempts to unify and further inform the field.},

@article{Kim2008,
abstract = {The microstructure and properties of a material depend on dynamic processes such as defect motion, nucleation and growth, and phase transitions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can spatially resolve these nanoscale phenomena but lacks the time resolution for direct observation. We used a photoemitted electron pulse to probe dynamic events with "snapshot" diffraction and imaging at 15-nanosecond resolution inside of a dynamic TEM. With the use of this capability, the moving reaction front of reactive nanolaminates is observed in situ. Time-resolved images and diffraction show a transient cellular morphology in a dynamically mixing, self-propagating reaction front, revealing brief phase separation during cooling, and thus provide insights into the mechanisms driving the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis.},

@article{Berger1978,
abstract = {Despite common misconceptions, domain walls are too thick to ''scatter'' electrons appreciably. However, electrons crossing a wall apply a torque to it, which tends to cant the wall spins. This could be used to measure the conduction electron spin polarization. Most of the low‚Äêfield resistive anomalies observed in pure Fe, Ni and Co at low temperature are caused by the Lorentz force associated with the internal field B=M s present inside each domain. The existence of low‚Äêresistivity paths extending over many domains accounts for still unexplained magnetoresistance data in ironwhiskers. In uniaxial materials, a d.c. eddy‚Äêcurrent loop caused by the Hall effect runs around each wall. The field H z generated by these loops tends to ''drag'' the whole domain structure in the direction of the carrier drift velocity. Also, the Joule dissipation of the eddy currents manifests itself as an excess Ohmic resistance. As predicted, this excess resistance decreases as the square of the field, in amorphous Gd25Co75 films, in MnBi films, and in pure bulk cobalt, when the walls are removed by an external field. The excess resistance can also be changed by reorienting the walls.},
