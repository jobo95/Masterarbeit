abstract = {Abstract The spatial variability of mean sea level pressure (SLP) and 500 mb height anomalies over the Southern Hemisphere during summer (DJF) and winter (JJA) is determined using eigenvector analysis based on daily synoptic maps from 1972 to 1979. The patterns of spatial distribution of pressure and height anomalies are further verified and examined by means of station data, and the eigenvectors are compared between the seasons and to those found for the Northern Hemisphere. The first eigenvector shows that midlatitude anomalies of SLP and 500 mb height are of an opposite sign to those found over and around Antarctica. The pattern is highly barotropic and suggests strengthening and weakening of the zonal wind in alternating latitude belts. The 500 mb height differences are calculated for five midlatitude to Antarctic station pairs using data from the late 1950's onward. These latitudinal height differences are also used to describe the association between the hemispheric westerlies and the Southern Oscil...},

abstract = {Abstract The role of eddies in modulating the Southern Ocean response to the southern annular mode (SAM) is examined, using an ocean model run at multiple resolutions from coarse to eddy resolving. The high-resolution versions of the model show an increase in eddy kinetic energy that peaks 2–3 yr after a positive anomaly in the SAM index. Previous work has shown that the instantaneous temperature response to the SAM is characterized by predominant cooling south of 45°S and warming to the north. At all resolutions the model captures this temperature response. This response is also evident in the coarse-resolution implementation of the model with no eddy mixing parameterization, showing that eddies do not play an important role in the instantaneous response. On the longer time scales, an intensification of the mesoscale eddy field occurs, which causes enhanced poleward heat flux and drives warming south of the oceanic Polar Front. This warming is of greater magnitude and occurs for a longer period than the ...},

abstract = {Abstract Eigenvector or principal component analysis has been carried out on monthly means of surface pressure, temperature, and rainfall defined on grids extending over both hemispheres and the tropical belt. In each case, 10 out of a possible 120 components were sufficient to account for more than 80{\%} of the observed variance regardless of whether the annual cycle was first removed. The major pressure components can be interpreted in terms of meridional and land-sea temperature gradients, and reflect a basic difference in the seasonal cycle in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. While both pressure and temperature show coherent departures on a hemispheric scale, rainfall components are regional in character, and the variance reduction is more evenly distributed over the major components. The use of principal components as climatological indices merits greater attention than has so far been given.},

abstract = {Abstract Long-term trends and interannual variations of circulation anomalies in the Southern Hemisphere are examined using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis from 1949 to 1998. The changes in planetary circulation regimes are linked to global sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs). Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was performed on 500-hPa height anomalies. The leading mode EOF1 shows a strong zonal symmetry with a phase reversal between height anomalies in high and midlatitudes. Apart from zonal symmetry, a zonal wavenumber 3 is evident with three centers located in three southern oceans. In the low-frequency band with fluctuations longer than 60 months, EOF1 is associated with the second rotated EOF mode of SSTAs with positive loadings over three southern oceans and negative loadings in the North Pacific and the North Atlantic. The next two modes are the Pacific–South American (PSA) patterns. They depict wave-3 patterns in...},

abstract = {AbstractPerturbations in the southern annular mode (SAM) are shown to be significantly correlated with SST anomalies in the central tropical Pacific during austral winter and SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific during austral summer. The SAM signature in the Pacific sector resembles a tropically forced Rossby wave train, the so-called Pacific–South American pattern, while the signature in the Indian Ocean sector is a zonally elongated meridional dipole. Thus, the SAM contains strong zonally asymmetric variability and tends to behave differently in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, with internal dynamics prevailing in the Indian Ocean sector and the forced response to tropical SST anomalies exerting a strong influence in the Pacific sector. The tropically forced component of the SAM in the Pacific sector is related to a geographically fixed active Rossby wave source to the east of Australia within the core of the subtropical jet. In addition to the well-documented positive trend in summer, the...},

A rule of thumb indicating when an EOF is likely to be subject to large sampling fluctuations is presented.

However, despite the identification of relationships between SAM and Australia's hydroclimate using certain data sets, and focussed on certain time periods, the association has not been extensively explored and significant uncertainties remain. One reason for this is the existence of numerous indices, methods and data sets by which SAM has been approximated. In this paper, the various SAM definitions and indices are reviewed and the similarities and discrepancies are discussed, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each index development approach. Further, the sensitivity of the relationship between SAM and Australian rainfall to choice of SAM index is quantified and recommendations are given as to the most appropriate index to use when assessing the impacts of the SAM on Australia's hydroclimate. Importantly this study highlights the need to consider the impact that the choice of SAM index, and data set used to calculate the index, has on the outcomes of any SAM attribution study.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

First the period over 1951–2011 is considered, and it is shown that there are differences in the SAM and jet trends between the CMIP5 models, the Hadley Centre gridded SLP (HadSLP2r) dataset, and the Twentieth Century Reanalysis. The relationships between these trends demonstrate that the SAM index cannot be used to directly infer changes in any one kinematic property of the jet. The spatial structure of the observed trends in SLP and zonal winds is shown to be largest, but also most uncertain, in the southeastern Pacific. To constrain this uncertainty six reanalyses are included and compared with station-based observations of SLP.

Comparisons reveal the models do not fully simulate the duration of strong natural variability within the reconstructions during the 1930s and 1960s. Seasonal indices are examined to understand the relative roles of forced and natural fluctuations. The models capture the recent (1957–2005) positive SAM trends in austral summer, which reconstructions indicate is the strongest trend during the last 150 yr; ozone depletion is the dominant mechanism driving these trends. In autumn, negative trends after 1930 in the reconstructions are stronger than the recent positive trend. Furthermore, model trends in autumn during 1957–2005 are the most different from observations. Both of these conditions suggest the recent autumn trend is most likely natural climat...},

Through an analysis of a simulation for 1871–2200 by the CSIRO Mark 3 climate model, the extent to which these might both be described as “annular modes,” based on their statistical patterns, physical mechanisms, and usefulness in climate study, is assessed. The modes are determined as EOF1 and EOF2 of vertically integrated zonal and monthly mean zonal wind, for 1871–1970. These match well those from ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA) data and also from the earlier Mark 2 model. The mode index time series relate to largely annular patterns of local wind and surface pressure anomalies [with HLM giving the familiar southern annular mode (SAM)], and other simulated quantities. While modes calculated from 90° sectors are only moderately correlated (mostly in the polar region) for HLM, the link increases with time scale. There is little such relationship for LLM.

Because it is difficult to separate the contribution of various external forcings to the observed trend, a state-of-the-art global coupled model is utilized here. Ensembles of twentieth-century simulations forced with the observed time series of greenhouse gases, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, sulfate aerosols, volcanic aerosols, solar variability, and various combinations of these are used to examine the annular mode trends in comparison to observations, in an attempt to isolate the response of the climate system to each individual forcing. It is found that ozone changes are the biggest contributor to the observed summertime intensification of the southern polar vortex in the second ...},

abstract = {Abstract Several papers have described a significant trend toward the positive phase of the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) in recent decades. The SAM is the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) so such a change implies a major shift in the broadscale climate of this hemisphere. However, the majority of these studies have used NCEP–NCAR reanalysis (NNR) data, which are known to have spurious negative trends in SH high-latitude pressure. Thus, given that the SAM describes the relative atmospheric anomalies at mid- and high southern latitudes, these errors in the NNR data have the potential to invalidate the published findings on changes in the SAM. Therefore, it is important that a “true” benchmark of trends in the SAM is available against which future climate scenarios as revealed through climate models can be examined. In this paper this issue is addressed by employing an empirical definition of the SAM so that station data can be utilized to evaluate true tempo...},

First the period over 1951–2011 is considered, and it is shown that there are differences in the SAM and jet trends between the CMIP5 models, the Hadley Centre gridded SLP (HadSLP2r) dataset, and the Twentieth Century Reanalysis. The relationships between these trends demonstrate that the SAM index cannot be used to directly infer changes in any one kinematic property of the jet. The spatial structure of the observed trends in SLP and zonal winds is shown to be largest, but also most uncertain, in the southeastern Pacific. To constrain this uncertainty six reanalyses are included and compared with station-based observations of SLP. The CMIP5 mean SLP trends generally agree well with the direct observations, despite some climatological biases,...},

The glacier is coupled to the ocean by the Totten Ice Shelf, which has exhibited variable speed, thickness, and grounding line position in recent years. To understand the drivers of this interannual variability, we compare ice velocity to oceanic wind stress and find a consistent pattern of ice-shelf acceleration 19 months after upwelling anomalies occur at the continental shelf break nearby. The sensitivity to climate forcing we observe is a response to wind-driven redistribution of oceanic heat and is independent of large-scale warming of the atmosphere or ocean. Our results establish a link between the stability of Totten Glacier and upwelling near the East Antarctic coast, where surface winds are projected to intensify over the next century as a result of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.},

Representing variations in pressure and the corresponding changes to the circumpolar zonal flow, it is typically thought of as an “annular” or ringlike structure. However, on seasonal time scales the zonal symmetry observed in the SAM in monthly or annual mean data is much less marked. This study further examines the seasonal changes in the SAM structure and explores temperature signals across the Southern Hemisphere that are strongly tied to the asymmetric SAM structure.The SAM asymmetries are most marked in the Pacific sector and in austral winter and spring, related to changes in the jet entrance and exit regions poleward of 30°S. Depending on the season, the asymmetric SAM structure explains over 25{\%} of the variance in the overall SAM structure and has strong connections with ENSO or zonal wavenumber 3.

In this paper, the predictions of the Chemistry-Climate Model Validation (CCMVal) models are examined: Unlike the AR4 models, the CCMVal models have a fully interactive stratospheric chemistry. Owing to the expected disappearance of the ozone hole in the first half of the 21st century, the CCMVal models predict that the tropospheric westerlies in Southern Hemisphere summer will be decelerated, on the poleward side, in contrast with the prediction of most IPCC/AR4 models.},

It cancels a large proportion of the positive feedback by synoptic- and smaller-scale eddies in the zonal mean, resulting in a very weak overall eddy feedback on the SAM. CMAM is deficient in ...},

Persistence on these time scales is found in patterns of variability that characterize meridional vacillations of the extratropical jet. Depending on the degree of asymmetry in the model forcing, patterns take on similar properties to the zonal index, annular modes, and North Atlantic Oscillation. It is found that the time scale of jet meandering is distinct from the obvious internal model time scales, suggesting that interaction between synoptic eddies and the large-scale flow establish a separate, intraseasonal time scale. A mechanism is presented by which eddy heat and momentum transport couple to retard motion of the jet, slowing its meridional variation and thereby extending the persistence of zonal index and annular mode anomalies.

It is argued that the largest and most significant tropospheric trends can be traced to recent trends in the lower stratospheric polar vortex, which are due largely to photochemical ozone losses. During the summer-fall season, the trend toward stronger circumpolar flow has contributed substantially to the observed warming over the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia and to the cooling over eastern Antarctica and the Antarctic plateau.},

This is true not only in observations but also in an unforced 15 000-yr integration of a coarse-resolution (R15) coupled ocean–atmosphere model. Here it is documented how this mode of atmospheric variability, known as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), generates ocean circulation and sea ice variations in the model integration on interannual to centennial timescales that are tightly in phase with the SAM. The positive phase of the SAM is associated with an intensification of the surface westerlies over the circumpolar ocean (around 60°S), and a weakening of the surface westerlies farther north. This induces Ekman drift to the north at all longitudes of the circumpolar ocean, and Ekman drift to the south at around 30°S. Through mass continuity, the Ekman drift generates anomalous upwelling along the margins of the Antarctic continent...},

@article{Taylor2012,
abstract = {The fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) will produce a state-of-the- art multimodel dataset designed to advance our knowledge of climate variability and climate change. Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades...},

@article{Thompson2000,
abstract = {Abstract The leading modes of variability of the extratropical circulation in both hemispheres are characterized by deep, zonally symmetric or “annular” structures, with geopotential height perturbations of opposing signs in the polar cap region and in the surrounding zonal ring centered near 45° latitude. The structure and dynamics of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode have been extensively documented, whereas the existence of a Northern Hemisphere (NH) mode, herein referred to as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), has only recently been recognized. Like the SH mode, the AO can be defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function of the sea level pressure field or of the zonally symmetric geopotential height or zonal wind fields. In this paper the structure and seasonality of the NH and SH modes are compared based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis and supplementary datasets. The structures of the NH and SH annular modes ...},
